# The Contacts Manager

Assume you're writing a Java program that's responsible for storing and managing all your friends' contact information.

We'll start by creating a class that's responsible for storing all contact information of a single person, it will look something like this:
```
class Contact{
   String name;
   String email;
   String phoneNumber;
}
```
All fields, no methods, since a contact object itself won't be "doing" much actions itself in the scope of this program, it's merely a slightly more advanced data type that can store a few strings in 1 variable.

Note: Noticed how we used a `String` to store the phone number instead of using `int`! Can you think of a reason why?

- Because phone numbers start with 0's and integers can't store leading 0's
- Because the largest integer is smaller than a typical phone number

Let's create the class that will be in charge of adding and searching for contacts. Since it will be managing all the contacts, I'll call it `ContactsManager`:
```
class ContactsManager {
}
```
This class will be storing the contacts in an array, which means one of its fields will be an array of Contacts, another field will be an `int` representing the number of friends added to the array, this `int` will help us know where in the array was the last contact added so we can continue to add more contacts into the array later as we will see.

This is what the class will look like after adding the fields

```
class ContactsManager {
   // Fields:
   Contact [] myFriends;
   int friendsCount;
}
```
Okay, now let's create a `default constructor` that will initialize those fields.
```
class ContactsManager {
   // Fields:
   Contact [] myFriends;
   int friendsCount;
   // Constructor:
   ContactsManager(){
      this.friendsCount = 0;
      this.myFriends = new Contact[500];
   }
}
```
The friendsCount starts from `0`and will increment every time we add a new contact later.

The Contact array `myFriends` (just like any array) needs to be initialized using the `new` keyword and we chose to reserve enough space in the array to store up to 500 contacts.

Next, let's start adding methods to the `ContactsManager` class that allows adding and searching for contacts in the array.
